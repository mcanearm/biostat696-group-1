	abstract = {To conserve biodiversity it is imperative that we understand how different species respond to land use change, and determine the scales at which habitat changes affect species' persistence. We used habitat suitability models (HSMs) at spatial scales from 100–4000m to address these concerns for bats in the Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of global importance where the habitat requirements of bats are poorly understood. We used acoustic and capture data to build fine scale HSMs for ten species (Hesperoptenus tickelli, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis horsfieldii, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Megaderma spasma, Hipposideros pomona, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus indorouxii and Rhinolophus lepidus) in a tea-dominated landscape. Small (100–500m) scale habitat variables (e.g. percentage tea plantation cover) and distances to habitat features (e.g. distance to water) were the strongest predictors of bat occurrence, likely due to their high mobility, which enables them to exploit even small or isolated foraging areas. Most species showed a positive response to coffee plantations grown under native shade and to forest fragments, but a negative response to more heavily modified tea plantations. Two species were never recorded in tea plantations. This is the first study of bats in tea plantations globally, and the first ecological Old World bat study to combine acoustic and capture data. Our results suggest that although bats respond negatively to tea plantations, tea-dominated landscapes that also contain forest fragments and shade coffee can nevertheless support many bat species.},

	abstract = {Farmland harbors valuable biodiversity, providing habitats and associated resources for birds. However, environmental change is affecting the habitat availability within agricultural landscapes. Thus, conserving farmland areas that have the potential to provide habitats for birds is increasingly considered to mitigate pressure on ecological systems. Incorporating these concerns into bird habitat analysis to aid in conservation actions is needed to assist policy developers in protecting bird habitats in Taiwan efficiently. In the present study, we propose combining an expert-based approach with empirical data to develop an evaluation of bird habitat suitability on farmlands. Experts were initially gathered to construct a research framework and then express their judgments on ecological factors. We obtained the significant factors such as farmland fragmentation, farmland landscape heterogeneity, and distance to surrounding vegetation within fifteen evaluated sub-criteria under four criteria of farmland functionality, farmland utilization, farmland located within a major conservation area, and farmland landscape ecology as the habitat requirements of birds. Combing the weight-based priority and empirical data, we finally determined a highly suitable habitat for birds accounting for 31.92\% of farmlands. In an assessment involving bird distribution records in the study area, the accuracy derived from model validation is 91.25\%. The findings of this work can provide authorities and policymakers with potential hotspots for ecosystem conservation.},

	abstract = {While some agricultural landscapes can support wildlife in the short term, it is uncertain how well they can truly sustain wildlife populations. To compare population trends in different production systems, we sampled birds along 48 transects in mature forests, diversified farms, and intensive farms across Costa Rica from 2000 to 2017. To assess how land use influenced population trends in the 349 resident and 80 migratory species with sufficient data, we developed population models. We found, first, that 23\% of species were stable in all three land use types, with the rest almost evenly split between increasing and decreasing populations. Second, in forest habitats, a slightly higher fraction was declining: 62\% of the 164 species undergoing long-term population changes; nearly half of these declines occurred in forest-affiliated invertivores. Third, in diversified farms, 49\% of the 230 species with population changes were declining, with 60\% of these declines occurring in agriculture-affiliated species. In contrast, 51\% of the species with population changes on diversified farms showed increases, primarily in forest-affiliated invertivores and frugivores. In intensive farms, 153 species showed population changes, also with similar proportions of species increasing (50\%) and decreasing (50\%). Declines were concentrated in agriculture-affiliated invertivores and forest-affiliated frugivores; increases occurred in many large, omnivorous species. Our findings paint a complex picture but clearly indicate that diversified farming helps sustain populations of diverse, forest-affiliated species. Despite not fully offsetting losses in forest habitats, diversified farming practices help sustain wildlife in a critical time, before possible transformation to nature-positive policies and practices.},

	abstract = {This dataset contains results from acoustic monitoring for bats at 276 sites across the Great Lakes basin and Upper Midwest From 2010 - 2018. These data provide information on the magnitude, timing, and species composition of bat activity across the region. These data were collected by the US Fish and Wildlife Service Region 3 Avian Radar Team (https://www.fws.gov/radar) funded by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, as well as USFWS Field Offices, the University of Minnesota, and various collaborators including Bat Conservation International, Texas Christian University, US Geological Survey, Western Ecosystems Technology Inc., and organizations listed here: https://www.fws.gov/radar/links/index.html
METHODS:
All detectors (Wildlife Acoustics SM2Bat+) were deployed at approximately 1 m above ground level on fence posts or existing structures. PVC cups were placed around microphones to block extraneous ground noise but allow acoustic signals from overhead. Detectors were not placed beneath completely closed canopy where possible, to provide partially or fully open sky above. Detectors ran autonomously for 10 - 14 days on external batteries. Recordings were made via triggering operation under default settings with a 1 s trigger window, recording to 15-minute WAC compressed files. A low-pass filter excluding sounds below 16 kHz was applied. Data were recorded to SD cards and transferred to headquarters by field personnel. WAC files were decompressed using WAC2WAV utility, with split triggers ON. Kaleidoscope Pro v. 4.3.2 (-1 liberal setting) was used for species identification, with species classifiers (the group of species included in analysis as potential species to be identified) selected for each site using IUCN range maps, plus a 50 km buffer. Automated species identifications have not been manually vetted for accuracy, and may contain false identifications.  Nightly Pass Counts represent only nights when 8 or more WAC files (indicating 2 hours or more of detector operation) were recorded. Nights with fewer than 8 WAC files, or with data that indicated detector malfunction were removed from Nightly Pass Counts, but may be represented in Pass Lists.

	abstract = {This data release contains the results from the North American Bat Monitoring Program's report titled 'Status and Trends of North American Bats Summer Occupancy Analysis 2010-2019'. Specifically, these data include tabular data and geospatial data for the species-specific results related to the status and trends of 12 bat species at multiple spatial scales including: 10 km x 10 km grid cells, state/province/territories, and range-wide across the geographic extent of monitoring data for each species (i.e., across 'modeled species ranges'). They were produced using an analytical pipeline supported by web-based infrastructure for integrating continental scale bat monitoring data (stationary acoustic, mobile acoustic, and capture records) to assess the summer (May 1-Aug 31) population status and trends of North American bat species across their modeled ranges at multiple spatial scales. An occupancy model was estimated for each species while accounting for biases from false positives (i.e., misclassification error) and false negatives (i.e., detectability). Then, using the estimated relationships between grid cell occupancy probabilities for each species with ecological and spatiotemporal predictors, maps of species occupancy probabilities were produced for each year of sampling, for each NABat grid cell in each species' 'modeled range'. Finally, status and trends indicators across larger spatial extents (e.g. range-wide, state/territory/province) were derived based on the grid cell level occupancy probabilities over time. A tabular file is included for each species detailing the occupancy probability predictions of each 10 km x 10 km grid cell in each modeled species range, with predictions (means, and the 95\% credible intervals) for every year of monitoring data. Next, a geospatial layer is provided that contains the merged NABat Master Sampling Grid (i.e., the union of sampling frames for Continental United States and Canada + Alaska ) with a unique grid cell identifier ('grts') to allow joining the tabular estimates to the NABat grid cells. This geospatial layer can assist grid cell level visualizations of species occupancy probability distributions over time, and also includes grid cell level occupancy covariates used in these analyses. Additional results include a tabular file that contains the range-wide and regional estimates of species status and trend including: the mean grid cell occupancy probability across each larger spatial extent (e.g., modeled species range, states/territories/provinces) for every species and year of species monitoring data analyzed. Two additional trend indicators for species occupancy (the average annual change rate, and the total change rate) were included in the same file, across several time frames including 3 years of change (and 4 years of monitoring data from 2016 - 2019) and where possible, also over 7 years of change (8 years of monitoring data from 2012 - 2019) and 9 years of change (10 years of monitoring data from 2010 - 2019).},

We study the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure. The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data.},
