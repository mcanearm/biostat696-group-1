# Introduction

## Why this dataset?

- Bats are an essential organism in North American ecosystems
- Insect control; pollination; seed dispersal
- Bat populations face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and white nose-syndrome [@noauthor_white-nose_nodate].
- Bat capture is often done through mist-netting; utilizing acoustic monitoring data more effectively could reduce the need for this method for individual bats


## Dataset 

- USFWS Great Lakes and Upper Midwest Acoustic Acoustic Bat Dataset [@noauthor_usfws_2019]
- Nightly counts of 14 species from acoustic monitoring stations in upper Midwest (and Texas, Iowa, and Pennsylvania)
- Each bat species has its own ultrasonic frequency that can be used to distinguish it from other species

## What is a "station"?

## Research Questions

- How do bat counts vary geographically?
- Do the counts of bats vary by species?
- How does distance to water affect these measurements?
- Is it better to consider distance to water a covariate or a coordinate?

## Data Processing 

- First, find closest bodies of water from all bodies of water via two sources: @noauthor_north_nodate @noauthor_usa_nodate
- For each year and species, sum detections
- ~3,300 total_records, several replicates across years at each of 273 stations
- Reduce the total number of records by summarizing across years

# Models

## Lat/Long Variograms
![](./images/lat_long_variograms.png)

## Lat/Long Variogram Analysis
- Variogram shows spatial dependence, but patterns vary greatly by species
- Three species with sensible lat/long variograms (exhibiting negative spatial dependence)
    - Big Brown Bat (EPTFUS)
    - Silver-Haired Bat (LASNOC)
    - Tri-colored Bat (PERSUB)
- These species range across all of our stations

## Non-Spatial Linear Model - Specification
- Fit a linear model (LM) with the following covariates:
    - Latitude, Longitude
    - Distance to nearest water body
    - Species
    
\begin{align*}
    Y &= X\beta + \epsilon \\ 
    \epsilon &\sim N(0, \sigma^2 I_n)
\end{align*}
    
## Non-Spatial Linear Model - Residuals
![](./images/linear_model_residuals.png){fig-align="center"}
    
## Spatial Linear Model
- From the LM, we see spatial dependence remaining in residuals
- Instead of using Lat/Long as covariates, what about spatial coordinates for a spatial LM?


## Spatial Linear Model - Specification

Our covariates are (1) Species, (2) Distance to Water.

Let $C_\theta$ represent the standard exponential kernel.

\begin{align*}
    \phi &\sim \text{Unif}(0.1, 25) \\
    \sigma^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 1) \\
    W \,|\, \phi, \sigma^2 &\sim MVN(0, C_{\theta}(\cdot, \cdot)) \\
    \beta &\sim N(0, 4I_n) \\
    \tau^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 1) \\
    Y \,|\, \phi, \sigma^2, W, \beta, \tau^2 &\sim MVN(X\beta + W, \tau^2I_n)
\end{align*}

## Spatial Linear Model - Performance

- Variogram of residuals still has some remaining spatial variation
- Spatial Variation is no longer significant by Moran's I test (p-value $\approx 0.57$)

## National Prediction

![Log(detctions/Night) for each of the three species. Largest estimated effects are difficult to see, but present in Michigan mitten.](./images/three_species_model/log_detections_national.png)


## Alt. Coordinate System

- Now use (latitude, distance to water) as spatial coordinates
- Normalize latitude and distance to water using z-score standardization to ensure similar scaling
- Fit on three selected species
- This new coordinate system may explain spatial patterns more cleanly than traditional lat/long since nearly all of our data is on the shores of the Great Lakes

## Alt. Coordinate System - Specification

Our covariates are (1) Species, (2) Longitude.

Let $C_\theta$ represent the standard exponential kernel.

\begin{align*}
    \phi &\sim \text{Unif}(0.0005, 40) \\
    \sigma^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 10.21^2) \\
    W \,|\, \phi, \sigma^2 &\sim MVN(0, C_{\theta}(\cdot, \cdot)) \\
    \beta &\sim N(0, I_n) \\
    \tau^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 0.1 \cdot 10.21^2) \\
    Y \,|\, \phi, \sigma^2, W, \beta, \tau^2 &\sim MVN(X\beta + W, \tau^2I_n)
\end{align*}

# A Spatial Poisson Regression Model

## Model Specification

- We again used the alternative coordinate system and normalized the coordinates.
- However, only the three species in the three-species model were used.
    - MCMC chains didn't converge when all species were used.
- Covariates:
    (1) Longitude (normalized)
    (2) Size of nearest water body (normalized)
    (3) Species

## Model Specification

Under the model,

$$
Y_k \sim \text{Poisson}(n_k\exp(\beta_0 + x_k^{\top}\beta + w_k))
$$

where, for site-species pair $k$,

- $Y_k$ is the number of detections
- $n_k$ is the number of operational nights
- $x_k$ is the covariate vector
- $w_k$ is the spatial random effect

## Model Specification

- A Poisson GLM without spatial random effects was first fit.
    - Let $\widehat{\beta}^{(0)}$ be the coefficient vector from the fitted model.
    - Let $V$ be the covariance matrix of $\widehat{\beta}^{(0)}$.
    - Let $\text{RSS}$ be the sum of squared residuals.

## Model Specification

Priors:
\begin{align*}
    \phi &\sim \text{Unif}(0.1, 10) \\
    \sigma^2 &\sim \text{IG}(\text{RSS}, 3\cdot\text{RSS}) \\
    \beta &\sim N(\widehat{\beta}^{(0)}, \sqrt{\text{diag}(V)}) \\
\end{align*}

# Research Questions

- Do the counts of bats vary geographically?
    - Yes! Areas with more water bodies, especially near the Great Lakes, seem to have higher counts of bats overall. Inland, there seem to be lower counts, but data sparsity could be playing a role.
- Do the counts of bats vary by species?
    - Yes! Our data see noticeable differences in these three species generally, which is to be expected based solely on species factors.
- How does distance to water affect these measurements?
    - Bat counts decrease negatively as distance to water increases, and our models found stable estimates on this coefficient.
- Is it better to consider distance to water a covariate or a coordinate?
    - Debateable, but by considering it as a covariate and not as a coordinate, we reduced the spatial dependence in our residuals.


# Future Work
