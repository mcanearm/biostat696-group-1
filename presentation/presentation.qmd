# Introduction

## Why this dataset?

- Bats are an essential organism in North American ecosystems
- Insect control; pollination; seed dispersal
- Bat populations face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and white nose-syndrome [@noauthor_white-nose_nodate].


## Dataset - USFWS Great Lakes and Upper Midwest Acoustic Acoustic Bat Dataset [@noauthor_usfws_2019]

- Nightly counts from acoustic monitoring stations in upper Midwest (and Texas, Iowa, and Pennsylvania)
- 14 Eligible species of bats

![Example acoustic monitoring station at Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site, South Dakota.](./images/bat_station.jpg)


## Species
- EPTFUS: big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus)
- LASBOR: eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) 
- LASCIN: hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) 
- LASNOC: silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) 
- MYOLUC: little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) 
- PERSUB: tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) 
- MYOSEP: northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) 

## Species (continued)
- MYOLEI: eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) 
- NYCHUM: evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) 
- MYOSOD: Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) 
- TADBRA: Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) 
- ANTPAL: pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) 
- CORRAF: Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) 
- LASINT: northern yellow bat (Lasiurus intermedius) 


## Research Questions

- Do the counts of bats vary geographically?
- Do the counts of bats vary by species?
- How does distance to water affect these measurements?
- Is it better to consider distance to water a covariate or a coordinate?

## Lat/Long Variograms

## Data Processing 

- First, find closest bodies of water from all bodies of water via two sources: @noauthor_north_nodate @noauthor_usa_nodate
- For each year and species, sum detections
- ~3,300 total_records, several replicates across years at each of 273 stations
- Reduce the total number of records if summarizing across years

# Models


## Three-Species Model

- Three species with sensible lat/long variograms 
    - Big Brown Bat (EPTFUS)
    - Silver-Haired Bat (LASNOC)
    - Tri-colored Bat (PERSUB)
- These species range across all of our stations

## Three-Species Model - Specification

Let $C_\theta$ represent the standard exponential kernel. We use a simple model to start,
with the distance function decided completely by latitude and longitude. Our
covariates are (1) Species and (2) Distance to Water 


\begin{align*}
    \beta &\sim N(0, 4I_n) \\
    \phi &\sim \text{Unif}(0.1, 25) \\
    \sigma^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 1) \\
    \tau^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 1) \\
    
    W &\sim MVN(0, C_{\theta}(\cdot, \cdot))\\
    
    Y &\sim MVN(X\beta + W, \tau^2I_n)
\end{align*}


# Three-Species Model - Fitting

## Three-Species Model - Performance

- Variogram of residuals still has some remaining spatial variation
- Confirmed by Moran's I-test (0.39, $p \approx 0$).

## Three-Species Model - Spatial Effects

![](./images/three_species_model/estimated_spatial_effects.png)

## Alt. Coordinate System

- Distance to water important for stable food source for bats
- Alternatively, use (latitude, distance to water) as spatial coordinates
- Normalize latitude and distance to water using z-score standardization to ensure similar scaling
- Fit on all species

## Alt. Coordinate System - Specification

Let $C_\theta$ represent the standard exponential kernel. We use a simple model to start,
with the distance function decided completely by latitude and distance to water (normalized) Our
covariates are (1) Species, (2) Longitude, and (3) Size of Nearest Water Body


\begin{align*}
    \beta &\sim N(0, I_n) \\
    \phi &\sim \text{Unif}(1.5, 15) \\
    \sigma^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 24.44^2) \\
    \tau^2 &\sim \text{IG}(2, 0.1 \cdot 24.44^2) \\
    
    W &\sim MVN(0, C_{\theta}(\cdot, \cdot))\\
    
    Y &\sim MVN(X\beta + W, \tau^2I_n)
\end{align*}

## Potential New Covariates

- Urban/rural
- Agricultural Outputs
- Land Use
- TODO: Add raster for estimated spatial effects across US including use of distance to water, and for each species
