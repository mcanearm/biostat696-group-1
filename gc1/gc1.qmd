# Introduction

- Our goal is to investigate the ranges of bat populations located along the shores of the Great Lakes. Specifically, we are interested in the following research questions:
    - Which species have the largest ranges
    - How population density varies with distance to the shore
    - How stable different species' ranges have been, i.e., how much their ranges have changed over time
- We downloaded a point-referenced dataset called the [USFWS Great Lakes and Upper Midwest Acoustic Bat Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usfws-great-lakes-and-upper-midwest-acoustic-bat-dataset) [@usfws_bat_acoustic_data].
    - The downloaded dataset contains one row for each pair of a site and a night on which data was recorded at that site. For each of several species, there are columns giving the number of detected bats belonging to the species.
    
# Downloaded Dataset Structure

Some of the columns in the first few rows of the downloaded dataset are shown below. In total, there are `r nrow(full_data)` observations from `r nrow(full_metadata)` sites.
```{r}
full_data %>% select(AcousticSite, NightOf, EPTFUS, LASBOR) %>% head()
```

# Downloaded Dataset Structure

```{r}
bat_species_lookup <- list(
    "EPTFUS" = "Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus)",
    "LASBOR" = "Eastern Red Bat(Lasiurus borealis) ",
    "LASCIN" = "Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus)",
    "LASNOC" = "Silver-Haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans)",
    "MYOLUC" = "Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus)",
    "PERSUB" = "Tri-Colored Bat (Perimyotis subflavus)",
    "MYOSEP" = "Northern Long-Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis)",
    "MYOLEI" = "Eastern Small-Footed Bat (Myotis leibii)",
    "NYCHUM" = "Evening Bat (Nycticeius humeralis)",
    "MYOSOD" = "Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis)",
    "TADBRA" = "Mexican Free-Tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis)",
    "ANTPAL" = "Pallid Bat (Antrozous pallidus)",
    "CORRAF" = "Rafinesque's Big-Eared Bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii)",
    "LASINT" = "Northern Yellow Bat (Lasiurus intermedius)",
    "ALL" = "All Species"
)
```
- We have data on `r length(bat_species_lookup) - 1` species. Some examples are the `r bat_species_lookup[1]` (referred to as `r names(bat_species_lookup)[1]` in the data), `r bat_species_lookup[2]` (`r names(bat_species_lookup)[2]`), and `r bat_species_lookup[3]` (`r names(bat_species_lookup)[3]`).
- Hence, the dataset we downloaded contains `r nrow(full_data)` observations, each of which contains a site, a date, and counts of detections for `r length(bat_species_lookup) - 1` different species.

# Sites

The map below reveals that a number of sites are far away from the Great Lakes. Those sites are in southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, central Indiana, southern Pennsylvania, and Texas.

# Sites

<!-- This slide is based on data/process_raw_data_metadata.qmd -->

We eliminated data from sites far away from the Great Lakes. We are left with `r nrow(data)` observations from `r nrow(metadata)` sites.

```{r}
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = usa, color = "black", fill = "white") +
    geom_sf(data = ontario, color = "black", fill = "white") +
    geom_sf(data = great_lakes, color = "lightblue", fill = "lightblue") +

    coord_sf(xlim = c(-123, -69), ylim = c(25, 50)) +
    labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", title = "Site Locations") +

    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

# Missingness

<!-- This slide is based on gc1/victor_eda.qmd -->

- There are no *explicit* missing values. However, there are quite a few *implicit* missing values, as the sensors are only active for certain nights of the year.
- Also, we're interested in bats generally, but the sensors are only equipped to detect certain species of bats.
- The line plot on the next slide shows how many sites have data by night.
    - There are stretches of time where no sites were producing data; they start toward the end of one year and end early the next year.
    - There are strange dips that occur in the middle of the year.
    - Many more sites produced data in the early 2010s than later in the decade.

# Missingness

```{r}
site_counts_by_night <- data %>%
    group_by(NightOf) %>%
    summarize(num_sites = length(AcousticSite))
site_counts_by_night <- complete(
    site_counts_by_night,
    NightOf = full_seq(NightOf, period = 86400),
    fill = list(num_sites = 0)
)
site_counts_by_night %>%
    ggplot(aes(NightOf, num_sites)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Night", y = "Number of Sites with Data")
```

# Data Aggregation

<!-- This slide is based on gc1/victor_eda.qmd -->

```{r}
count_cols <- setdiff(names(data), c("AcousticSite", "NightOf"))
zero_count_cols <- data %>%
    summarize(across(all_of(count_cols), ~ any(.x > 0))) %>%
    discard(isTRUE) %>%
    names()
count_cols <- setdiff(count_cols, zero_count_cols)
non_ALL_count_cols <- setdiff(count_cols, "ALL")
```

We aggregated the data by site. For each site, we computed the number of nights with data, and for each species, we computed the number of detections per night. A portion of the aggregated dataset is shown below.
```{r}
#| message: FALSE

data_rollup <- data %>%
    group_by(AcousticSite) %>%
    summarize(
        num_nights = length(NightOf), across(all_of(count_cols) & !ALL, sum)
    ) %>%
    rowwise(AcousticSite, num_nights) %>%
    summarize(across(all_of(non_ALL_count_cols), ~ .x / num_nights)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    inner_join(
        select(metadata, AcousticSite, Long, Lat), by = "AcousticSite"
    ) %>%
    relocate(Long, Lat, .after = AcousticSite)
data_rollup %>% select(AcousticSite, num_nights, EPTFUS, LASBOR) %>% head()
```

# Spatial Aspects of the Data

- The spatial domain of the data consists of the shores of the Great Lakes region.
- The dimension of the spatial domain is two, with the spatial locations of observations being indexed by latitude and longitude.
- It seems reasonable to model covariance as decaying with distance, as sites near each other should be in the ranges of roughly the same bat populations, so their detection figures should be roughly the same. In contrast, sites far away from each other should be in the ranges of different bat populations and should thus have dissimilar detection figures.

# Spatial Aspects of the Data

- We imagine that spatial dependence will play a role between the variables in the dataset because there should be a large spatial dependence in the counts of bats for nearby detectors. We expect that because certain species each have limited ranges that are spatially determined by habitat factors, then the individual sensors are likely to pick up only certain bats, and therefore nearby sensors should see similar counts of bats.

# Histograms

On the next slide are histograms that show the distributions of the detections/night variables for the various species. Each variable is right-skewed; for most sites, the ratios are close to zero, and for a few, the ratios are large.

# Histograms

```{r}
#| message: FALSE

data_rollup %>%
    select(non_ALL_count_cols) %>%
    pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "var", values_to = "val") %>%
    ggplot(aes(val)) +
    facet_wrap(vars(var), scales = "free") +
    labs(x = "Variable", y = "Count") +
    geom_histogram()
```


# Correlations

```{r}
cor_tbl <- data_rollup %>%
    select(non_ALL_count_cols) %>%
    cor() %>%
    as_tibble(rownames = "var1") %>%
    pivot_longer(!var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "cor")
max_cor <- cor_tbl %>%
    filter(var1 != var2) %>%
    slice_max(cor, n = 1) %>%
    slice(1)
```

On the next slide is a correlogram that shows the correlations between the detections/night variables for the various species. The only strong correlation between different species is between `r max_cor$var1` (`r bat_species_lookup[[max_cor$var1]]`) and `r max_cor$var2` (`r bat_species_lookup[[max_cor$var2]]`); it equals `r signif(max_cor$cor, 2)`.

# Correlations

```{r}
cor_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(var1, var2, fill = cor)) +
    labs(x = "Variable 1", y = "Variable 2", fill = "Correlation") +
    geom_tile() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, angle = 30), legend.position = "top")
```


# Empirical Covariograms

The covariograms computed from the aggregated data suggest wildly differing spatial dependences across bat species when ignoring temporal variation, including both positive and negative spatial dependence.

# Spatial Visualizations

It is difficult to discern any patterns in the spatial variation of the mean number of sightings per night by species. The lack of a clear spatial pattern continues even when we filter out seeming outliers in the number of mean number of mean sightings per night.

# A Potential DAG

Below is a potential DAG for our problem.
![](dag.jpg)
---

# A Potential DAG

In the DAG, $\text{MVN}(0, \Sigma)$ represents a multivariate Gaussian random vector consisting of detections per night for various sites. We assume a mean zero Gaussian process, where the covariance is modeled using a kernel function (e.g., a Matern kernel) and all hyperparameters are independent. The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is based on a kernel represented by $\kappa$; $\ell$ and $\sigma$ represent the length and variance scales, respectively.

For our DAG, we only have observations of spatial variables and currently have no additional covariates. 


# Anticipated Results, Potential Problems, and Additional Data

- We anticipate that bat populations will drop off as one moves inland, as bats require bodies of water such as rivers in their habitats. Likewise, we anticipate that spatially adjacent sites will have similar populations of bats.
- Our model is limited in that most data is collected along the Great Lakes shores, so extrapolation may be difficult.
- Additional inland bat population observations could be helpful, as well as covariates related to distance from the nearest water way and wind farm.
