# Introduction

- Our goal is to investigate the ranges of bat populations located along the shores of the Great Lakes. Specifically, we are interested in the following research questions:
    - Which species have the largest ranges
    - How population density varies with distance to the shore
    - How stable different species' ranges have been, i.e., how much their ranges have changed over time
- We downloaded a point-referenced dataset called the [USFWS Great Lakes and Upper Midwest Acoustic Bat Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usfws-great-lakes-and-upper-midwest-acoustic-bat-dataset) [@usfws_bat_acoustic_data].
    - The downloaded dataset contains one row for each pair of a site and a night on which data was recorded at that site. For each of several species, there are columns giving the number of detected bats belonging to the species.
    
# Downloaded Dataset Structure

Some of the columns in the first few rows of the downloaded dataset are shown below. In total, there are `r nrow(full_data)` observations from `r nrow(full_metadata)` sites.
```{r}
full_data %>% select(AcousticSite, NightOf, EPTFUS, LASBOR) %>% head()
```

# Downloaded Dataset Structure

```{r}
species_counts <- read_xlsx(
    here("data/raw/USFWS_Bat_Acoustic_Data/NightlyPassCounts.xlsx")
)
sites <- read.csv(here("data/raw/Bat_Detector_Metadata/acoustic_sites.csv"))
load(here("data/processed/data_metadata.RData"))

bat_species_lookup <- list(
    "EPTFUS" = "Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus)",
    "LASBOR" = "Eastern Red Bat(Lasiurus borealis) ",
    "LASCIN" = "Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus)",
    "LASNOC" = "Silver-Haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans)",
    "MYOLUC" = "Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus)",
    "PERSUB" = "Tri-Colored Bat (Perimyotis subflavus)",
    "MYOSEP" = "Northern Long-Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis)",
    "MYOLEI" = "Eastern Small-Footed Bat (Myotis leibii)",
    "NYCHUM" = "Evening Bat (Nycticeius humeralis)",
    "MYOSOD" = "Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis)",
    "TADBRA" = "Mexican Free-Tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis)",
    "ANTPAL" = "Pallid Bat (Antrozous pallidus)",
    "CORRAF" = "Rafinesque's Big-Eared Bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii)",
    "LASINT" = "Northern Yellow Bat (Lasiurus intermedius)",
    "ALL" = "All Species"
)
```

- We have data on `r length(bat_species_lookup) - 1` species. Some examples are the `r bat_species_lookup[1]` (referred to as `r names(bat_species_lookup)[1]` in the data), `r bat_species_lookup[2]` (`r names(bat_species_lookup)[2]`), and `r bat_species_lookup[3]` (`r names(bat_species_lookup)[3]`).
- Hence, the dataset we downloaded contains `r nrow(full_data)` observations, each of which contains a site, a date, and counts of detections for `r length(bat_species_lookup) - 1` different species.

# Missingness

<!-- This slide is based on gc1/victor_eda.qmd -->

- There are no *explicit* missing values. However, there are quite a few *implicit* missing values, as the sensors are only active for certain nights of the year.
- Also, we're interested in bats generally, but the sensors are only equipped to detect certain species of bats.
- The line plot on the next slide shows how many sites have data by night.
    - There are stretches of time where no sites were producing data; they start toward the end of one year and end early the next year.
    - There are strange dips that occur in the middle of the year.
    - Many more sites produced data in the early 2010s than later in the decade.

# Missingness

<!-- This slide is based on gc1/victor_eda.qmd -->

```{r}
site_counts_by_night <- data %>%
    group_by(NightOf) %>%
    summarize(num_sites = length(AcousticSite))
site_counts_by_night <- complete(
    site_counts_by_night,
    NightOf = full_seq(NightOf, period = 86400),
    fill = list(num_sites = 0)
)
site_counts_by_night %>%
    ggplot(aes(NightOf, num_sites)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Night", y = "Number of Sites with Data")
```

# Data Aggregation

<!-- This slide is based on gc1/victor_eda.qmd -->

```{r}
count_cols <- setdiff(names(data), c("AcousticSite", "NightOf"))
zero_count_cols <- data %>%
    summarize(across(all_of(count_cols), ~ any(.x > 0))) %>%
    discard(isTRUE) %>%
    names()
count_cols <- setdiff(count_cols, zero_count_cols)
non_ALL_count_cols <- setdiff(count_cols, "ALL")
```

We aggregated the data by site. For each site, we computed the number of nights with data, and for each species, we computed the number of detections per night. A portion of the aggregated dataset is shown below.
```{r}
#| message: FALSE

data_rollup <- data %>%
    group_by(AcousticSite) %>%
    summarize(
        num_nights = length(NightOf), across(all_of(count_cols) & !ALL, sum)
    ) %>%
    rowwise(AcousticSite, num_nights) %>%
    summarize(across(all_of(non_ALL_count_cols), ~ .x / num_nights)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    inner_join(
        select(metadata, AcousticSite, Long, Lat), by = "AcousticSite"
    ) %>%
    relocate(Long, Lat, .after = AcousticSite)
data_rollup %>% select(AcousticSite, num_nights, EPTFUS, LASBOR) %>% head()
```

# Spatial Aspects of the Data

- The spatial domain of the data consists of the shores of the Great Lakes region.
- The dimension of the spatial domain is two, with the spatial locations of observations being indexed by latitude and longitude.
- It seems reasonable to model covariance as decaying with distance, as sites near each other should be in the ranges of roughly the same bat populations, so their detection figures should be roughly the same. In contrast, sites far away from each other should be in the ranges of different bat populations and should thus have dissimilar detection figures.

# Spatial Aspects of the Data

- We imagine that spatial dependence will play a role between the variables in the dataset because there should be a large spatial dependence in the counts of bats for nearby detectors. We expect that because certain species each have limited ranges that are spatially determined by habitat factors, then the individual sensors are likely to pick up only certain bats, and therefore nearby sensors should see similar counts of bats.

# Histograms

On the next slide are histograms that show the distributions of the detections/night variables for the various species. Each variable is right-skewed; for most sites, the ratios are close to zero, and for a few, the ratios are large.

# Histograms

```{r}
#| message: FALSE

data_rollup %>%
    select(non_ALL_count_cols) %>%
    pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "var", values_to = "val") %>%
    ggplot(aes(val)) +
    facet_wrap(vars(var), scales = "free") +
    labs(x = "Variable", y = "Count") +
    geom_histogram()
```


# Correlations

```{r}
cor_tbl <- data_rollup %>%
    select(non_ALL_count_cols) %>%
    cor() %>%
    as_tibble(rownames = "var1") %>%
    pivot_longer(!var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "cor")
max_cor <- cor_tbl %>%
    filter(var1 != var2) %>%
    slice_max(cor, n = 1) %>%
    slice(1)
```

On the next slide is a correlogram that shows the correlations between the detections/night variables for the various species. The only strong correlation between different species is between `r max_cor$var1` (`r bat_species_lookup[[max_cor$var1]]`) and `r max_cor$var2` (`r bat_species_lookup[[max_cor$var2]]`); it equals `r signif(max_cor$cor, 2)`.

# Correlations

```{r}
cor_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(var1, var2, fill = cor)) +
    labs(x = "Variable 1", y = "Variable 2", fill = "Correlation") +
    geom_tile() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, angle = 30), legend.position = "top")
```


# Empirical Covariograms

The covariograms computed from the aggregated data suggest wildly differing spatial dependences across bat species when ignoring temporal variation, including both positive and negative spatial dependence.

# Spatial Visualizations

It is difficult to discern any patterns in the spatial variation of the mean number of sightings per night by species. The lack of a clear spatial pattern continues even when we filter out seeming outliers in the number of mean number of mean sightings per night.

# A Potential DAG

Below is a potential DAG for our problem.
![](dag.jpg)
---

# A Potential DAG

In the DAG, $\text{MVN}(0, \Sigma)$ represents a multivariate Gaussian random vector consisting of detections per night for various sites. We assume a mean zero Gaussian process, where the covariance is modeled using a kernel function (e.g., a Matern kernel) and all hyperparameters are independent. The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is based on a kernel represented by $\kappa$; $\ell$ and $\sigma$ represent the length and variance scales, respectively.

For our DAG, we only have observations of spatial variables and currently have no additional covariates. 


# Anticipated Results, Potential Problems, and Additional Data

- We anticipate that bat populations will drop off as one moves inland, as bats require bodies of water such as rivers in their habitats. Likewise, we anticipate that spatially adjacent sites will have similar populations of bats.
- Our model is limited in that most data is collected along the Great Lakes shores, so extrapolation may be difficult.
- Additional inland bat population observations could be helpful, as well as covariates related to distance from the nearest water way and wind farm.

# Preparation of the Data for Model-Building


We decided to use data from all of the sites instead of just the data from the sites along the Great Lakes. Below is a map that shows all of the sites.

# Preparation of the Data for Model-Building

The map below shows all of the non-Texas stations.
![](non_tx_map.png)
---

# Preparation of the Data for Model-Building

There's one record for each pair of `AcousticSite` and `Year`. Most sites only have data for a single year.
```{r}
data %>%
    count(AcousticSite, name = "num_years") %>%
    count(num_years, name = "num_sites")
```

# Preparation of the Data for Model-Building

More sites have data for `r count(data, Year, sort = TRUE)$Year[1]` than for any other year.
```{r}
count(data, Year, sort = TRUE, name = "num_sites")
```

# Preparation of the Data for Model-Building

<!-- For each site-year pair, we count the number of species that could be detected at the site in the year. -->
```{r}
num_detectable_species <- data %>%
    select(ends_with("_meta")) %>%
    apply(1, function(r) sum(r == "yes"))
```

We create a dataset that we can fit models to. There is one record for each site-year pair. The response is `ALL`, the number of detections across all species. `Lat` and `Long` will be used as spatial covariates. We will use `dist_to_water`, the number of nights on which the detectors were operational, and the number of detectable species as non-spatial covariates.
```{r}
data_for_mods <- data %>%
    select(
        AcousticSite, Year,
        ALL,
        Lat, Long,
        dist_to_water, starts_with("nights_")
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(
        starts_with("nights_"),
        names_to = "num_nights_year", names_prefix = "nights_",
        values_to = "num_nights"
    ) %>%
    filter(Year == num_nights_year) %>%
    select(!num_nights_year) %>%
    add_column(num_detectable_species)
```

# Non-Spatial Linear Model

To begin with, we fit a simple linear model of counts across all species. Under the model, at any location $s$, 
$$
\log(1 + Y(s)) \sim N(\beta_0 + X(s)^{\top} 
\beta, \sigma^2),
$$ {#eq-nonspatial-lm}
where $X(s)$ is the vector whose components are the distance from $s$ to the shore, the number of operational nights, and the number of detectable species.

The residual variance from the nonspatial linear model is ~2.4, which corresponds to about ~1.3 standard deviations on the logged counts scale.

```{r}
lm_nonspatial <- lm(
  log1p(ALL) ~ dist_to_water + num_nights + num_detectable_species, data = data_for_mods
)
data_for_mods$resid2 <- lm_nonspatial$residuals
print(paste0("Residual variance: ", var(data_for_mods$resid2)))
```

# Non-Spatial Linear Model

The residuals show strong spatial correlation (with longitude and latitude as spatial coordinates), as demonstrated in the empirical semivariogram.

# Non-Spatial Linear Model

```{r}
#| cache: true

lm_nonspatial_sv <- data_for_mods %>% with(geoR::variog(
    data = resid, coords = cbind(Long, Lat), 
    uvec = 10, messages=FALSE
))
lm_nonspatial_sv_df <- data.frame(
  dists = lm_nonspatial_sv$u, variogram = lm_nonspatial_sv$v, 
  npairs = lm_nonspatial_sv$n, sd = lm_nonspatial_sv$sd
)

ggplot(lm_nonspatial_sv_df, aes(x=dists, y=variogram)) + 
    geom_point(size=2, shape=8) +
    theme_minimal() + 
    xlab("Distances") +
    ylab("Variogram")
```

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

Noting that the spatial dependence that was not aptly captured by the simple linear model, we instead consider a spatial Gaussian process model. Under the model, at any location $s$,
$$
\log(1 + Y(s)) \sim GP(\beta_0 + X(s)^{\top} 
\beta, \tau^2 I_n + C_{\theta}(\cdot)),
$$ {#eq-spatial-lm}
where $X(s)$ is as above.

For our choice of covariance kernel function, we use an exponential covariance, 
$$
C_{\sigma^2, \phi}(s,s') = \sigma^2 \exp\{-\phi ||s - s'||_2\},
$$
where $\sigma^2$ and $\phi$ are parameters to be fitted.

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

Note that the spBayes package runs into computational issues with fitting when observations have spatial replicates, so we pre-process the data by jittering and adding slight noise on the order of $10^{-6}$ degrees (about $0.11$ m).

```{r}
#| cache: TRUE

# Pseudo-deduplicate data
data_for_mods_pseudo_dedup <- data_for_mods |> mutate(
    Long_jitter = jitter(Long, amount = 1e-6),
    Lat_jitter = jitter(Lat, amount = 1e-6)
)

    "tau.sq.IG"=c(2, 0.1 * 2.4) # Assume 10% of variance is due to noise
)
cov.model <- "exponential"

# Fit model on "ALL" species, using slightly perturbed Lat/Long data.
lm_spatial <- spLM(
    log1p(ALL) ~ dist_to_water + num_nights + num_detectable_species - 1, data = data_for_mods_pseudo_dedup, 
    coords = as.matrix(data_for_mods_pseudo_dedup[,c("Long_jitter", "Lat_jitter")]), 
    starting = starting, tuning = tuning, priors = priors, 
    cov.model = cov.model, n.samples = n.samples, verbose = FALSE, n.report = 500
) 
lm_spatial_fit <- lm_spatial %>% spRecover(start=round(n.samples/3), verbose=FALSE)
```

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

With the model fit, we check diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence.

To begin, we check the trace plots for convergence. We see that $\beta$, $\sigma^2$, and $\tau^2$ reach reasonable convergence, but $\phi$ has trouble converging. This remains true even when tweaking the prior parameters, starting values, and step sizes.

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

```{r}
# Check trace plots
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
ts.plot(lm_spatial_fit$p.beta.recover.samples[,1], main = "beta", ylab = "")
ts.plot(lm_spatial_fit$p.theta.recover.samples[,1], main = "sigma^2", ylab = "")
ts.plot(lm_spatial_fit$p.theta.recover.samples[,2], main = "tau^2", ylab = "")
ts.plot(lm_spatial_fit$p.theta.recover.samples[,3], main = "phi", ylab = "")
```

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

Likewise, looking at the autocorrelation function plots, we see that there is reasonably strong autocorrelation between $\phi$ posterior samples, even at lags of 20-30, indicating further issues with the MCMC fitting. 

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

```{r}
# Check ACF plots 
autocorr.plot(as.mcmc(lm_spatial_fit$p.theta.recover.samples))
```

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

Looking further, we see we have acceptance rates of about 20\% and effective sample sizes of 100+ observations.

```{r}
# Check acceptance rates and effective sample size
print(lm_spatial_fit$acceptance)
print(effectiveSize(as.mcmc(lm_spatial_fit$p.theta.recover.samples)))
```

# Linear Model with Spatial Covariance

Given the poor convergence of the $\phi$ parameter, we are inclined to explore other models beyond the linear model, possibly such as Poisson regression models which are better suited for count data.

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

We first fit a Poisson regression model without overdispersion or underdispersion. Under the model, at any location $s$,
$$
    Y(s) \sim \text{Poisson}(\exp\{\beta_0 + X(s)^{\top}\beta\}),
$$ {#eq-nonspatial-poisson}
where $X(s)$ is the vector whose components are the distance from $s$ to the shore, the number of operational nights, and the number of detectable species.
```{r}
mod1 <- glm(
    ALL ~ dist_to_water + num_nights + num_detectable_species,
    poisson,
    data_for_mods
)
mod1_fitted_vals_resids <- tibble(
    fitted_val = fitted(mod1), resid = resid(mod1)
)
```

Under the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson, $\mathbb{E}(Y(s)) = \text{Var}(Y(s))$, or $\sqrt{\mathbb{E}(Y(s))} = \text{SD}(Y(s))$. We use the residuals to check whether this property of the model is reasonable. For the $i$th observation, which was recorded at location $s_i$, we compare $\sqrt{\widehat{\mathbb{E}}(Y(s_i))}$ to the absolute residual $|Y(s_i) - \widehat{Y}(s_i)|$; if the property is reasonable, then these two quantities should be similar. Below, we plot the absolute residual versus the square root of the fitted value. The two are equal along the dashed line. For some observations, the absolute residual is much larger than expected. However, this isn't true systematically, so those observations may just be outliers. The absolute residuals that aren't close to the line seem to be below it more often than above it, which suggests underdispersion.

mod1_fitted_vals_resids %>%
    ggplot(aes(sqrt(fitted_val), abs(resid))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +

    theme_bw()
```

Below is a histogram of the ratios of the absolute residual to the square root of the fitted value; the dashed line is at one. The histogram reiterates the messages of the scatterplot above.

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

```{r}
mod1_fitted_vals_resids %>%
    mutate(ratio = abs(resid) / sqrt(fitted_val)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(ratio)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 100, color = "black", fill = "white") +
    geom_vline(linetype = "dashed", xintercept = 1) +
    labs(
        x = expression("Absolute Residual" / sqrt("Fitted Value")),
        y = "Number of Observations"
    )
```

<!-- Below is a function for computing the Pearson dispersion statistic. -->
```{r}
calc_pearson_disperse_stat <- function(mod) {
    sum(resid(mod)^2 / fitted(mod)) / df.residual(mod)
}
```

The Pearson dispersion statistic for the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson is below.
```{r}
calc_pearson_disperse_stat(mod1)
```

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

To continue assessing the fit of the model, we generate 100 samples of counts under the model. We will compare how the counts in these samples are distributed to how the real counts are distributed.
```{r}
samples <- replicate(
    100,
    rpois(nrow(data_for_mods), mod1_fitted_vals_resids$fitted_val)
) %>%
    `colnames<-`(str_c("sample", 1:100)) %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    pivot_longer(
        everything(),
        names_to = "sample", names_prefix = "sample",
        values_to = "ALL"
    ) %>%
    bind_rows(tibble(sample = "0", ALL = data_for_mods$ALL), .)
```

In the plot below, there is one density estimate for each sample (the gray curves) as well as a density estimate for the real data (the blue curve). The tails look fairly similar, but the blue curve's peak is to the left of the gray curves' peaks. This suggests that the count under the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson tends to be somewhat larger than it should be.

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

```{r}
samples %>%
    mutate(is_real_data = sample == "0") %>%
    ggplot(aes(ALL, group = sample, color = is_real_data)) +
    scale_color_manual(
        labels = c(`TRUE` = "Real", `FALSE` = "Simulated"),
        values = c(`TRUE` = "blue", `FALSE` = "gray")
    ) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(x = "Response", y = "Density", color = "Data Type")
```

We next compute the empirical semivariogram of the residuals from the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson. Since there are replicates for some sites, we need to jitter the coordinates to make things work. We use 100 bins to compute the empirical semivariogram.
```{r}
#| output: FALSE

mod1_variogram <- bind_cols(data_for_mods, mod1_fitted_vals_resids) %>%
    select("Long", "Lat", "resid") %>%
    as.geodata() %>%
    jitterDupCoords(max = 1e-4) %>%
    variog(uvec = 100, messages = FALSE)
```

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

The empirical semivariogram suggests spatial dependence only over small distances. We can try fitting a Poisson regression model with spatial random effects.

# A Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

```{r}
mod1_variogram %>%
    plot(
        type = "o",
        main = "Empirical Semivariogram of Residuals",
        xlab = "Distance", ylab = "Semivariance"
    )
```

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

We next try a Quasi-Poisson regression model, i.e., one for which the dispersion parameter is estimated instead of being fixed at one.
```{r}
mod2 <- glm(
    ALL ~ dist_to_water + num_nights + num_detectable_species,
    quasipoisson,
    data_for_mods
)
mod2_fitted_vals_resids <- tibble(
    fitted_val = fitted(mod2), resid = resid(mod2)
)
```

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

Below is a summary of the fitted model. Note that the estimated dispersion parameter is large, so the fitted model is similar to the first fitted model.

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

```{r}
summary(mod2)$call
summary(mod2)$coefficients
str_glue("dispersion: {summary(mod2)$dispersion}")
```

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

Since the dispersion parameter estimate is large, the scatterplot of the absolute residual versus the square root of the fitted value looks almost exactly like the first scatterplot.

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

```{r}
mod2_fitted_vals_resids %>%
    ggplot(aes(sqrt(fitted_val), abs(resid))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_abline(linetype = "dashed", slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
    labs(x = expression(sqrt("Fitted Value")), y = "Absolute Residual") +
    theme_bw()
```

# A Quasi-Poisson Regression Model without Spatial Random Effects

The Pearson dispersion statistic did not change.
```{r}
calc_pearson_disperse_stat(mod2)
```

# A Poisson Regression Model with Spatial Random Effects

Since the empirical semivariogram of the residuals for the Poisson regression model suggests spatial dependence over small distances, we next fit a Poisson regression model with spatial random effects.

To avoid numerical issues, we jitter the coordinates of the sites.
```{r}
jittered_data_for_mods <- mutate(
    data_for_mods,
    Lat = jitter(Lat, factor = 1e-4), Long = jitter(Long, factor = 1e-4)
)
```

# A Poisson Regression Model with Spatial Random Effects

We fit a model with an exponential covariance function.

- We use the coefficient vector from the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson as the starting value for $\beta$.
- Since $\sigma^2$ is the variance of a spatial random effect, we use as its starting value the variance of the residuals from the model in @eq-nonspatial-poisson.
- The starting value for $\phi$ is the reciprocal of the distance at which spatial dependence seems to begin weakening in the empirical semivariogram above.
- Finally, we use zeros as the starting values for the spatial random effects $w$.

Unfortunately, the acceptance rate is close to zero. The `spGLM()` call is in the QMD file for these slides. We have tried fiddling with the values of `starting`, `tuning`, and `priors` to increase the acceptance rate, but we have not found values that work well yet.
```{r}
#| cache: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

mod1_coefs <- coef(mod1)
mod1_resid_var <- var(resid(mod1))
mod3 <- spGLM(
    ALL ~ dist_to_water + num_nights + num_detectable_species,
    family = "poisson",
    data = jittered_data_for_mods,
    coords = as.matrix(jittered_data_for_mods[c("Lat", "Long")]),
    starting = list(
        beta = mod1_coefs, sigma.sq = mod1_resid_var, phi = 0.5, w = 0
    ),
    tuning = list(
        beta = 0.1 * abs(mod1_coefs),
        sigma.sq = 0.1 * mod1_resid_var,
        phi = 0.001,
        w = 0
    ),
    priors = list(
        sigma.sq.ig = c(2, 3 * mod1_resid_var),
        phi.unif = c(0.1, 1),
        beta.normal = list(mod1_coefs, 0.33 * sqrt(abs(mod1_coefs)))
    ),
    cov.model = "exponential",
    n.samples = 5000,
    verbose = TRUE,
    n.report = 100
)
```

The acceptance rate is just `r mod3$acceptance`\%.
